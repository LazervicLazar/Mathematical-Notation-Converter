Mathematical-Notation-Converter
## Introduction

Notation conversion is a common task in computer science and mathematics, often used in the evaluation of expressions and parsing. This C++ program provides an easy-to-use interface for converting expressions between different notations. Whether you need to convert a postfix expression to infix, prefix to postfix, or any other combination, this tool has you covered.

## Features

- Supports conversion between postfix, infix, and prefix notations.
- Utilizes a deque (doubly linked list) data structure for efficient notation conversions.
- Error handling for invalid characters.
- Clear and user-friendly command-line interface.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- C++11 or later
- Terminal or command prompt
